	<p>Our recruiters work onsite to thoroughly understand the culture of your company so we can talk to exceptional candidates about what really matters to them: the work. 
 
	<p>Perks and bonuses are important, but we understand that what truly makes an opportunity great is the work you do and the impact you make. Today's engineers and developers don't need a traditional recruiter; they need an agent. </p>

	<p>As the flow of talent and capital to Silicon Beach increases, it's now more important than ever to focus not only on building great internal teams, but building a sustainable tech ecosystem for all of Southern California.</p>

	<p>We're not your typical recruiters. At Silicon Beach Talent, we only partner with companies that we'd want to work for ourselves. We focus on the intangibles that make you connect with a company so we can understand what matters to you when considering a new position. </p>

	<p>Our partners are fun, innovative companies with aggressive goals and even more aggressive visions. They're not just looking for a set of skills, they're looking for someone to stand beside them to tackle insane challenges. </p>

	<p>That's why we spend time onsite with all our partners, to get to know their mission and their culture, so we know when it resonates with your career objectives. </p>

	<p>In the end, our goal is simple:</p>
