				<h2>A Southern California Tech Fusion</h2>
				<p>As the flow of talent and capital to Silicon Beach increases, it's now more important than ever to focus not only on building great internal teams, but building a sustainable tech ecosystem for all of Southern California.  We do this through our three recruitment divisions:</p>
				<div class="dropdown-container">
					<div class="dropdown-label">Work</div>
					<ul class="dropdown">

				<h2>Culture fit + Inspiring Work = A Big Impact</h2>
				<p>Our recruiters work onsite to thoroughly understand the culture of your company so we can talk to exceptional candidates about what really matters to them: the work. </p>

				<p>Perks and bonuses are important, but we understand that what truly makes an opportunity great is the work you do and the impact you make. </p>

				<p>Today's engineers and developers don't need a traditional recruiter; they need an agent. </p>

				<h2>Not Your Typical Recruiters</h2>
				<p>At Silicon Beach Talent, we only partner with companies that we would want to work for ourselves. </p>

				<p>We focus on the intangibles that make you connect with a company so we can understand what matters to you when considering a new position. </p>

				<p>Our partners are fun, innovative companies with aggressive goals and even more aggressive visions. </p>

				<p>They are not just looking for a set of skills, they are looking for someone to stand beside them to tackle insane challenges. </p>

				<h2>It's about the IMPACT</h2>
				<p>There is a lot of noise in the job market with the rise of anonymous job matching sites, but they are all missing the point.  You want the whole picture, not just a quick description and a salary estimate.  That's why we spend time onsite with all our partners. We understand every clientâ€™s mission and culture, so we know when it resonates with your career objectives. </p>
	 
				<p>In the end, our goal is simple: </p>
